/*
 PrePublish-Deployment Script Template							
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This file is for scripts that need to run prior to msbuild comparing the project 
 to the target database.

 Basically like old db toast pre-deployment scripts.

 Create your scripts in the PrePublish-Deployment Scripts folder and then reference 
 below as 

		:r ".\Deploy\PrePublish-Deployment Scripts\<<MY FILE>>.sql"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
